## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Implementation

Our architecture follows Clean Architecture principles with three well-defined layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer                  │
│  • Screens (UI)                             │
│  • Widgets (Reusable Components)            │
│  • ViewModels (Business Logic)              │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│           Domain Layer                      │
│  • Models (Entities)                        │
│  • Repositories (Data Orchestration)        │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
┌──────────────────▼──────────────────────────┐
│            Data Layer                       │
│  • Services (Mock / Firebase)               │
│  • Data Sources (API / Local Storage)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Architectural Patterns

**1. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
- Clear separation between UI and business logic
- Testable ViewModels using Riverpod Notifiers
- Reactive state updates with minimal boilerplate

**2. Repository Pattern**
- Single source of truth for all data operations
- Orchestrates between multiple services seamlessly
- Handles business logic and data transformation

**3. Service Abstraction**
- Interface-based service design for flexibility
- Interchangeable implementations (Mock/Firebase)
- Environment-based configuration (dev/prod)

**4. Dependency Injection**
- Provider-based DI using Riverpod
- Easy unit testing and mocking
- Scoped lifecycle management

### Environment Configuration

Timely supports two environments:

- **Development (`FLAVOR=dev`)**: Uses mock data, no Firebase required
- **Production (`FLAVOR=prod`)**: Full Firebase integration with real-time sync

Switch between environments with a simple command flag.
